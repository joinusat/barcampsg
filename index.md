## WHAT IS A BARCAMP AND WHO ARE THE ATTENDEES?

Barcamps are meetups where people come together to learn from each other.  We discuss a range of topics - design,  books, science, movies, space exploration, health, food, tech (and its implication on society), travel and more. You are welcome to propose a topic for discussion. The particpants vote and select the topics they want to join.
